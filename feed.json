No dice.\n\nWith the firewall up and ports blocked again, I configured Screens to establish an SSH tunnel (as written on Mark’s guide) and then connect VNC. Copying the SSH keys from the MacBook Pro and setting Screens to connect to localhost got it working. The desktop appeared on my iPad Pro! Not bad.\n\nA quick install of a lightweight browser, Midori, completed the exercise. A couple of reboots made sure that everything is automatically launched on boot. Now my cloud desktop is up and running. \n\n\n\nAnyway, I prefer working locally, i.e., not on the cloud (yeah, I don’t like using online productivity suites like Google Docs or Office365), and on the device (not a fan of Chromebooks, too). When your internet connection is expensive and unreliable, then you’d understand.\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1135/2022/433db6a354.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"419\" alt=\"screenshot of Screens Remote Desktop iPadOS app\" />\n",

It is a convenient way to manage your YouTube video library without logging on YouTube and giving more data points to Google.

				"content_text": "An annual celebration marked by events that educate and inform young ones and young once on how to be safe on the internet. On the main website, [Safer Internet Day](https://www.saferinternetday.org), you will see that it is supported by the likes of Facebook, Google, Tiktok and Twitter, four of the largest online services where users are not safe.\n\nEvents promoting Safer Internet Day (SID) often concentrate on online bullying, specially on these platforms. It is like a tobacco company sponsoring a healthy smoking habit to children! It is rare to have an event where organizers tell participants to **stop using these companies' products and services** for fear of losing sponsorship money.\n\nFor fear of losing sponsorship money, SID event organizers will not tell users to protect their privacy and stop using products from Facebook, Google, Tiktok and Twitter. Event organizers will also not tell users in order to protect their mental health, they should avoid these same companies' products. \n\nSo how can you be safe on the internet when the narrative is controlled by companies that make the internet unsafe, right?\n\n## How to be safe on the internet? \n\nFor starters, **stop using Facebook, Google, Tiktok, Twitter, Viber, Instagram**, and use products and services that are privacy-centric. Here are some examples:\n\n1. Use Signal, Threema or Matrix/Element instead of using the messaging services from Facebook, Google, Telegram or Viber.  \n\n2. Use DuckDuckGo or Ecosia as your search engine. On DuckDuckGo, you can access Google Search without providing Google with your data. \n\n3. Use Fastmail or ProtonMail or Tutanota as your e-mail provider instead of Gmail.\n\n4. Use email aliases to hide and protect your main email address. Simplelogin.io, DuckDuckGo, Firefox, iCloud+, and Fastmail provide this service.\n\n5. Use a password manager (paired with email aliases) to ensure that passwords and email addresses are unique for each online service or app you sign-up on.\n\n6. Add your main email addresses on haveibeenpwned.com to monitor if they're compromised. Some password managers, like 1Password, have this monitoring feature built-in.\n\n6. Use yewtu.be to view YouTube videos or use youtube-dl or yt-dlp.org to download YouTube videos and watch it on your device without any trackers or recommended videos.\n\n7. Use Safari (if available) or DuckDuckGo (if available) or Firefox as your browsers (and change the default search engine to DuckDuckGo) instead of Chrome.\n\n8. Use mailing lists (e.g., groups.io) or a public chat/messaging service (e.g., matrix.org) to manage and engage with your community.\n\n9. Write on your own blog (e.g., micro.blog, wordpress, write.as), where you have control and ownership of your content. \n\n10. Use Flickr.com or Pixelfed.org to host your public photos. Do **not** overshare. If you think your innocent looking photo doesn't contain data that reveals where and when you have taken it, you are in for a surprise. Parents respect the privacy of your children - don't post photos of their faces - you will never know how it will be used against them in the future. \n\n11. Avoid feeding the trolls. The best way is to ignore. Same with bullies. \n\n12. Be kind. Having a safer internet means treating each other kindly and respecting others the way you want to be respected. \n\nI doubt that you will hear most of these from any of the Safer Internet Day events or they will lose their sponsorship deals! \n\nBe safe out there. \n\n",

				"content_html": "<p>A few days ago, I decided to tinker with an old Acer Aspire laptop in an attempt to make it useful again. It was running a previous version of Xubuntu, a lightweight Linux distribution, but nobody wantsed to use it because it was too damn slow. I could just imagine how it fares with Windows on it. I remember the time before I got my hands on those Linux installation diskettes, when I get frustrated with the way Windows crashes my desktop PC, and it was not a pleasant experience. This Acer Aspire, whilst it does not crash, it is too damn slow. Heck, my Raspberry Pi 4 is even faster! (Maybe because it is running Intel chips! Haha)</p>\n<p>Anyway, I decided to get an internal SSD drive to replace this uber-slow HDD. A 480GB Kingston SSD to replace a 500GB HDD is not much of a trade-off considering that it is not intended to be the main workstation (we have Macs for those). All it took was opening the bottom cover and replacing the HDD (I found out that there is still an empty memory slot, so that is the next upgrade, I guess).</p>\n<p>Next step was to decide which Linux distribution to install. I have read good reviews of Pop!_OS, Elementary OS and Zorin OS, and, of course, Ubuntu is still on my short list. Heck, I even thought of using the PC desktop version of Raspberry Pi OS! So I did download the installers for these distributions, with the exception of Elementary OS, which was taking too long to download, even on my 300Mbps connection!</p>\n<p>Using Balena Etcher on the Mac, I have flashed the Linux images on to different USB thumbdrives. Well, I scavenged to find old 8GB USB thumbdrives to use, since most of what I use currently are 64GB ones, which is overkill.</p>\n<p>Obviously, the Acer Aspire laptop (laptop) will no longer boot since the new SSD drive was not formatted with anything. Inserting the USB thumbdrive with the Linux image will force the laptop to boot off of the USB port and allow me to install Linux on it. Simple, right? Well, I thought it was. It took me several attempts doing this.</p>\n<p>First, I tried Pop!_OS. It would boot up, but would get stuck loading (maybe it was working, but I didn&rsquo;t have the patience to wait for it). Next, I tried Zorin OS. It booted up and was even able to install on the SSD. However, when I booted the laptop without the installer, the laptop complained that there&rsquo;s no bootable device detected. I tried Raspberry Pi OS, but it won&rsquo;t even boot (though I think this has something to do with the old thumbdrive). Ubuntu was the next one &ndash; same thing with Zorin OS. No bootable device was found! Frustrating.</p>\n<p>I thought that maybe I needed to check the BIOS and see if, for some reason, the boot sequence was changed. This laptop required a password to access the BIOS settings, and of course, I don&rsquo;t know the password. I tried to remove the CMOS battery and waited for a couple of minutes, but still was asked for the password. Good thing that some good soul published a tool on the web to generate possible passwords. I tried it and on the first try, I got in. The BIOS checked out fine - the boot sequence goes HDD first. I thought that maybe it is the Secure Boot that is making it impossible, considering that the new SSD wasn&rsquo;t factory installed - so I disabled it, too. I could live with having Secure Boot turned off since the laptop never leaves the house anyway, and is planned to not store personal data beyond browsing behaviour, maybe.</p>\n<p>With the new BIOS settings, I decided to try once again, but this time, I decided to go Linux Mint, since one of the kids will use it, too. Armed wth a USB thumbdrive with the Linux Mint installer, the laptop booted up and then continued and finished installing. The moment of truth, booting it up without the thumbdrive. Lo and behold! It failed again - this time, it went to show the grub prompt. Ah, progress. A couple of DuckDuckGo searches resulted in some grub configurations that needed to be applied. With some terminal ninjitsu, the laptop finally booted up to the desktop! Success, or so I thought.</p>\n<p>After using the laptop, updating the OS and applications, and creating the user accounts. The reboot resulted in that grub command line again! So after a couple more DuckDuckGo searches, I found a way to make it persistent. Applying the hack finally worked! <em>whew</em></p>\n<p>Moment of truth time. I asked one of the kids to try and login to check if the photos that I migrated from the old HDD to the new SSD drive, and there was a surprised look at how fast and responsive this laptop now is. Now I am off to checking out how much RAM costs, and maybe I can make this even faster next time! Currently, the laptop is running Timeshift and creating a snapshot of the system with an estimated time of 10 minutes. Not bad, right?</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, I did not manage to document the hacks that I have applied, but if you have an old Acer Aspire that you want to resurrect from being a useless door stopper, the solution is definitely out there (DuckDuckGo is your friend), but first you need to decide that you will use Linux, because that is what will ultimately make it useful!</p>\n",

Currently, the laptop is running Timeshift and creating a snapshot of the system with an estimated time of 10 minutes. Not bad, right?\n\nUnfortunately, I did not manage to document the hacks that I have applied, but if you have an old Acer Aspire that you want to resurrect from being a useless door stopper, the solution is definitely out there (DuckDuckGo is your friend), but first you need to decide that you will use Linux, because that is what will ultimately make it useful! \n",

				"title": "Twenty-two (22) iPhone applications for the year 2022 #noxp ",
				"content_html": "<p>You might have a new iPhone for the new year, or if you are looking at refreshing your iPhone and re-arranging applications on your home screen, here&rsquo;s a list of twenty-two (22) must-have iPhone applications for the year 2022 (in no particular order)</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Password Manager (1Password or BitWarden)\nGone are the days of having to memorize your passwords or using the same password for multiple accounts. A password manager is a must-have, so I highly recommend 1Password or BitWarden. That being said, iOS 15 comes with its own password manager with its own TOTP generator, which may be sufficient for most, but I find myself saving a couple of backup codes for some accounts or even texts and files, which iCloud Keychain does you yet support (hoping that notes can be supported by the keychain on iOS 16). Currently, I am using 1Password.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Privacy-oriented Email (Fastmail, ProtonMail or TutaNota)\nNow is the time to start using a privacy-oriented email service. Free e-mail services were attractive before because they offered unlimited storage, until they don&rsquo;t anymore. In addition, think of how companies that offer free services are paying for their infrastructure (by mining your data one way or another). You can choose one of these services and you will be sure that your privacy is protected.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Privacy-oriented Search Engine/Browser (DuckDuckGo)\nWhilst I defaut to using Safari with several settings configured so as to make my data even more private, I also recommend using DuckDuckGo browser on your iPhone (heard that they are coming up with a desktop version soon, too!). Remember that you can use DuckDuckGo browser and still get the Google search results you prefer without leaking your data to Google, just prefix your search terms with &ldquo;!g&rdquo;. And oh, it does come with a widget, too.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>E-mail Alias service (SimpleLogin)\nIt is one thing to use unique passwords for your accounts, but it is even safer if you have unique email addresses that is bundled with a unique password for your accounts. Associating different email address aliases to a single account (your main e-mail account) makes it a bit complicated for the machine learning model, specially when bundled with more privacy-enhancing services, such as VPNs. Anyway, I prefer using SimpleLogin for my e-mail aliases. FYI, that trick to use &ldquo;+&rdquo;, e.g. <a href=\"mailto:jose+google@gmail.com\">jose+google@gmail.com</a>, does not really provide you with added anonymity.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A VPN service (Windscribe and WireGuard)\nSpeaking of VPNs, I use Windscibe as it does not log my traffic, and their website does not contain trackers. When paired with e-mail aliases, your anonymity improves considerably! Now, I also have my own VPN, WireGuard, for protecting my internet traffic when anonymity is not that much needed (I wrote about this last year).  I recommend Windscribe for those who don’t have time to deploy their own VPN service.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Network-wide Ad Tracker Blocker (NextDNS)\nFor my personal use, I have a Pi-hole running on a Raspberry Pi on my home network. However, for others who do not have the time and extra money to spend on a Raspberry Pi and configuring it, there is NextDNS. This is one of the most flexible DNS service today - it supports ad blocking, tracker blocking, and much more. The NextDNS application on your iPhone makes it easier to use the service when you are away from your home network.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Privacy-oriented Messaging app (Signal)\nThe iPhone&rsquo;s default messaging app, Message, pretty much provides a privacy-oriented service, but only if you communicate with Apple device users. For cross-platform messaging service, nothing beats Signal at the moment. No, don&rsquo;t be duped by the end-to-end encrypted, secure communications that other services brag about (WhatsApp &amp; Viber - whilst they cannot peek at your messages, they collect your metadata and use it for profit, Telegram - their encryption is open, so good luck keeping your messages away from their prying eyes).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Browser ad and tracker blocker (1Blocker)\nAs an added protection, although it might seem overkill if you already have those mentioned above, but you can never be too safe, is to use a browser extension to block more sneaky trackers. With Better.fyi sunsetting, 1Blocker is now my go to browser extension!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Photo metadata stripper (ViewEXIF)\nThe iPhone is one of the popular devices for taking photos and sharing them. However, until recently with the new iOS versions, sharing a photo exposes its metadata, the EXIF information that contains, among other things, the exact location where the photo was taken. This is actually being exploited by social media companies - scraping the EXIF information to learn more about you. I recommend using an app that strips photos of the metadata before you share it, and for me, that is ViewEXIF - a simple tool that allows you to analyze your photo&rsquo;s metadata, but also strips it off for you to protect your privacy.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>An alternative camera app (Halide)\nFor those who prefer to have more camera controls that the default Camera app, I recommend Halide, which is one of the most powerful third-party camera apps out there, and what is even better is that it does not collect <em>any</em> of your data for their own use.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Photo Editing App (Pixelmator Photo)\nWe all have our favorite photo editor, but I cannot recommend Pixelmator Photo enough. This is a recently released iOS app and I am sure that you&rsquo;d like the power it provides.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Photo sharing (Flickr)\nBefore there was Instagram, Flickr ruled the internet. I have been using Flickr for a long time, and this service is a photo-sharing application with a great online community. There is a free-tier, but I&rsquo;d recommend upgrading to the Pro so you won&rsquo;t worry about using up the free storage provided. Either you give it a try or you revisit it, it is one photo sharing site that does not leak your personal information to other social media companies.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Photo Back-up App (PhotoSync)\nIf you are like me, I don&rsquo;t share all the photos that I take - some are just for family use only. For these photos (and also those that I share on Flickr), I back it up to local storage, and sometimes to an encrypted cloud storage, and for these, I use PhotoSync. What I like about this is that it supports a wide array of storage services, and I am sure that you&rsquo;ll find your preferred one there.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A Quick Note Taking app (Tot)\nThe iPhone has the Notes app built-in, but there are times that you just need a quick application for temporary storage of information, ala clipboard but more flexible, and that is where Tot comes in. I like that it has multiple tabs for storing different types of data, and you can even use Markdown to format it. This is best paired with the macOS Tot app, which syncs via iCloud.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Favorite Weather App (Carrot)\niOS 15 comes with a revamped Weather app that is gorgeous, but it does not have the snarky attitude of Carrot. Carrot is my go-to when the weather is gloomy as the snarky comments usually makes me smile.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Podcast app (Overcast)\niOS comes with the stock Podcast app, but I prefer Overcast. Yeah, it is not free, but it is feature-rich, and I like that it informs you whether the podcast producer inserted some trackers in their feed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>News Aggregator (NetNewsWire)\nReally Simple Syndication (RSS) has been around for quite sometime already. Before the centralization of content by social media companies, people used to have full control of their content (they own it, and some even monetize it) via blogs. To keep tabs of blogs and other news sites, RSS news aggrators were used to have a single application to retrieve the latest articles and consolidate it. RSS is still alive and well, and I prefer using NetNewsWire for this. Frankly, people should stop posting exclusively on social media, and instead post on their own blog (and post the URLs on social media) — that way, you have full ownership and control of your content.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Blogging App (Gluon and Micro.blog app)\nSpeaking of blogging, I use Micro.blog app and Gluon (a third-party Micro.blog app) to post on my Micro.blog site.  One thing that differentiates Micro.blog from other blogging platforms is the community — it is such a top-notch bunch of people who are respectful of each other. I’d say try it out - a free account will let you explore the community.  You can’t go wrong with any of these two applications.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Federated Social Network (Mastodon)\nIf there is one social network that rivals Twitter, it is Mastodon. First, it is free and open source software, so you can either self-host it yourself or join an existing instance or server. What makes it even better is that even if you are on one server, its federation system allows you to also follow and see posts from members of other servers or instances — very much unlike the single, centralized Twitter. Mastodon recently released its iOS application, Mastodon, which I prefer, but there are other third-party applications out there.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Social Network (Twitterific)\nSpeaking of Twitter, I still maintain an account on it - unlike Facebook and Instagram, which I ditched a long time ago. Whilst Twitter has its own iOS application, I prefer Twitterific. It is unfortunate that there are features that are only available on the official Twitter application, I am hoping that soon, these features will be opened up to third-party developers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>File Manager (ShellFish)\nApple has the Files application built-in, but if you wish to connect to remote servers using a better, more secure protocol (SSH/SFTP), then ShellFish is the way to go. I have this on both iOS and iPadOS devices as it makes sending and retrieving files from my Raspberry Pi and virtual private servers running Linux convenient and secure!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Internet Speed Test (Fast and Speedtest)\nWhen you live in a country with unreliable internet services, constantly measuring the speed of your internet connection is needed. If you have a Netflix account, Fast should be part of your arsenal. However, this is not recognized by your ISP’s technical support when troubleshooting your internet issues, so Ookla’s Speedtest is a must have.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These are my top 22 applications that I highly recommend that you check out.</p>\n<p>If you have learned something new, please don’t hesitate to donate to my coffee fund at <a href=\"https://buymeacoffee.com/Benguet\">https://buymeacoffee.com/Benguet</a>. Thank you.</p>\n",

This is a recently released iOS app and I am sure that you'd like the power it provides. \r\n\r\n12.  Photo sharing (Flickr)\r\nBefore there was Instagram, Flickr ruled the internet. I have been using Flickr for a long time, and this service is a photo-sharing application with a great online community. There is a free-tier, but I'd recommend upgrading to the Pro so you won't worry about using up the free storage provided. Either you give it a try or you revisit it, it is one photo sharing site that does not leak your personal information to other social media companies.\r\n\r\n13.  Photo Back-up App (PhotoSync)\r\nIf you are like me, I don't share all the photos that I take - some are just for family use only. For these photos (and also those that I share on Flickr), I back it up to local storage, and sometimes to an encrypted cloud storage, and for these, I use PhotoSync. What I like about this is that it supports a wide array of storage services, and I am sure that you'll find your preferred one there.\r\n\r\n14.  A Quick Note Taking app (Tot)\r\nThe iPhone has the Notes app built-in, but there are times that you just need a quick application for temporary storage of information, ala clipboard but more flexible, and that is where Tot comes in. I like that it has multiple tabs for storing different types of data, and you can even use Markdown to format it. This is best paired with the macOS Tot app, which syncs via iCloud.\r\n\r\n15.  Favorite Weather App (Carrot)\r\niOS 15 comes with a revamped Weather app that is gorgeous, but it does not have the snarky attitude of Carrot. Carrot is my go-to when the weather is gloomy as the snarky comments usually makes me smile. \r\n\r\n16.  Podcast app (Overcast)\r\niOS comes with the stock Podcast app, but I prefer Overcast. Yeah, it is not free, but it is feature-rich, and I like that it informs you whether the podcast producer inserted some trackers in their feed.\r\n\r\n17.  News Aggregator (NetNewsWire)\r\nReally Simple Syndication (RSS) has been around for quite sometime already. Before the centralization of content by social media companies, people used to have full control of their content (they own it, and some even monetize it) via blogs. To keep tabs of blogs and other news sites, RSS news aggrators were used to have a single application to retrieve the latest articles and consolidate it. RSS is still alive and well, and I prefer using NetNewsWire for this. Frankly, people should stop posting exclusively on social media, and instead post on their own blog (and post the URLs on social media) — that way, you have full ownership and control of your content. \r\n\r\n18.  Blogging App (Gluon and Micro.blog app)\r\nSpeaking of blogging, I use Micro.blog app and Gluon (a third-party Micro.blog app) to post on my Micro.blog site.  One thing that differentiates Micro.blog from other blogging platforms is the community — it is such a top-notch bunch of people who are respectful of each other. I’d say try it out - a free account will let you explore the community.  You can’t go wrong with any of these two applications.\r\n\r\n19.  Federated Social Network (Mastodon)\r\nIf there is one social network that rivals Twitter, it is Mastodon. First, it is free and open source software, so you can either self-host it yourself or join an existing instance or server. What makes it even better is that even if you are on one server, its federation system allows you to also follow and see posts from members of other servers or instances — very much unlike the single, centralized Twitter. Mastodon recently released its iOS application, Mastodon, which I prefer, but there are other third-party applications out there.\r\n\r\n20. Social Network (Twitterific)\r\nSpeaking of Twitter, I still maintain an account on it - unlike Facebook and Instagram, which I ditched a long time ago. Whilst Twitter has its own iOS application, I prefer Twitterific. It is unfortunate that there are features that are only available on the official Twitter application, I am hoping that soon, these features will be opened up to third-party developers.\r\n\r\n21.  File Manager (ShellFish)\r\nApple has the Files application built-in, but if you wish to connect to remote servers using a better, more secure protocol (SSH/SFTP), then ShellFish is the way to go. I have this on both iOS and iPadOS devices as it makes sending and retrieving files from my Raspberry Pi and virtual private servers running Linux convenient and secure!\r\n\r\n22. Internet Speed Test (Fast and Speedtest)\r\nWhen you live in a country with unreliable internet services, constantly measuring the speed of your internet connection is needed. If you have a Netflix account, Fast should be part of your arsenal. However, this is not recognized by your ISP’s technical support when troubleshooting your internet issues, so Ookla’s Speedtest is a must have.\r\n\r\nThese are my top 22 applications that I highly recommend that you check out. \r\n\r\nIf you have learned something new, please don’t hesitate to donate to my coffee fund at <https://buymeacoffee.com/Benguet>. Thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
